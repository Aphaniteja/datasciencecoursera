## This Folder contains the script for the Project

### This file describes the methodology behind the script

* First following the instructions of the project I have downloaded the required files. The data is also publicly available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

* The script loads  the traing set and traing labels ,and combines them into a single file.It does the same for the testing set.
